If in the future I add amenities for each room type, with the ability to later edit for a particular room, which design patter would be best. No need for implementation. Just explanation

For adding and editing amenities for room types and specific rooms, I recommend using the **Decorator** pattern combined with a **Strategy** pattern approach.

## Design Pattern Recommendation

The **Decorator** pattern would be ideal because:

1. It allows you to attach additional responsibilities (amenities) to objects dynamically
2. It provides flexibility to add or remove amenities for specific rooms without modifying the base room type
3. It supports layering of amenities (e.g., a room can have both "WiFi" and "MiniBar" amenities)
4. It respects the Open/Closed Principle by allowing extension without modifying existing code

The **Strategy** pattern complements this approach by:

1. Defining a family of algorithms (pricing strategies, availability rules) that can vary independently from the clients that use them
2. Making the amenity behaviors interchangeable and configurable

## Conceptual Implementation

You would create:

1. A base `RoomAmenity` interface or abstract class
2. Concrete amenity implementations (WiFi, MiniBar, RoomService, etc.)
3. A way to compose these amenities with rooms

Each room would have:
- A base room type (defining standard features)
- A collection of additional amenities (decorators)
- The ability to add/remove specific amenities

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new amenity types without changing existing code
- **Granularity**: Specific rooms can override their type's default amenities
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation between room types and their amenities
- **Scalability**: As your amenity system grows, it remains manageable
- **Business Rules**: Easily implement rules like "Penthouse rooms always include RoomService"

This design would allow you to define default amenities for each room type, while still maintaining the flexibility to customize amenities for individual rooms as needed.

Why will a factory design pattern not work?

The Factory pattern isn't necessarily wrong for this scenario, but it has limitations compared to the Decorator pattern when dealing with amenities that can be dynamically combined.

A Factory pattern would work well for:
- Creating different room types with their default amenities
- Ensuring consistency in how rooms of a particular type are created
- Centralizing the creation logic for rooms

However, it has these limitations for your amenity customization requirements:

1. **Limited Flexibility in Combinations**: Factories typically produce complete, pre-configured objects. For each unique combination of amenities, you would need a different factory method or subclass.
As the number of amenities grows, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially.

2. **Difficulty with Runtime Changes**: Factories aren't designed for modifying objects after creation. If you need to add or remove amenities from a specific room after it's 
created (which seems to be a requirement), a Factory alone wouldn't support this well.

3. **Static vs. Dynamic Composition**: The Factory pattern creates objects with a fixed set of characteristics. When you need to modify individual rooms with custom amenity combinations, you lose the dynamic composition benefit that Decorator provides.

4. **Granularity Issues**: To support every possible room + amenity combination with a Factory, you would either need a complex parameter-driven factory (which becomes unwieldy) or an explosion of factory methods/subclasses.

A Factory could still be useful in this design as part of the solution - particularly for creating the initial room types with their default amenities. Then the Decorator pattern would allow for the runtime customization of individual rooms.

If the combinations are actually limited and well-defined, then a Factory might be sufficient. But for a system where rooms can have any combination of amenities and these can change over time, the Decorator pattern offers more flexibility.
